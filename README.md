## Information
This is a project I am starting on in February of 2018. I have really fallen in
love with the <a href="http://www.mindmapping.com/">mind-map method</a> of
taking notes. The method suits my way of thinking and I love the flexibility it
provides. My intention for this project is to keep taking notes with pen and
paper, but later use this software to save my mind maps for easier referencing.
Funny enough, I actually wrote out the plan for this application across several
different mind maps.

There are many other mind map softwares out there, but I wanted to
create my own take on them in order to test both my motivation and creativity
with this project.

If this project takes off bigger than expected, I would like to eventually
revamp it in C++ with OpenGL from scratch. If that happens, this project can be
considered a prototype for the future.
